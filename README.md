# Paradox Kairos

![Preface picture](rmimages/vault_clock.jpg)

What this is:
1) A Python environment to explore computer capabilities and have them interlinked for greater purposes. OR: kitchen sink codebase.
2) A dreamt up paradox clock at AI heart with machine species called Kairos. OR: indie AI working on paradoxes and geometries instead of neural networks.

## Changes log
- START (25 Feb 2026):
Ongoing redesign of the codebase. Color space explorer is ready and inspiring, but not hooked up. Dealing with mobile IDEs like Pycoder and Termux. Evaluating need for Tkinter or HTML server. Created this git, might as well ship code that works and-or could be fpund interesting.
