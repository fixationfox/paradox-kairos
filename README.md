## Changes log
- START (25 Feb 2026):
Ongoing redesign of the codebase. Color space explorer is ready and inspiring, but not hooked up. Dealing with mobile IDEs like Pycoder and Termux. Evaluating need for Tkinter or HTML server. Created this git, might as well ship code that works and-or could be fpund interesting.
